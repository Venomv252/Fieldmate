    <div class="center leftalign">The pH of soil is a way to calculate if the soil is acidic or basic and this plays
        greatly in
        determining how much nutrients will be available for use by the plant, and each microbe. The pH of most plants
        has a slightly acidic to neutral (6.0-7.0). Alkaline or acidic soil pH does not release the required nutrients
        to the plant, which would result in low growth and crop yields. Scheduled soil tests and applications of
        potassium bicarbonate to correct low pH and lower pH for continued good growth.

                    reduce crop yield, increasing prices.</li>
                <li class="disc-li">Supply & Demand Imbalance – Higher demand or lower production can drive up costs
                </li>
                <li class="disc-li">Rising Input Costs – Higher prices of fertilizers, seeds, labor, and transportation
                    affect crop pricing.</li>
                <li class="disc-li">Government Policies & Subsidies – Import/export restrictions, taxes, and subsidies
                    impact market prices.</li>

    <div class="center leftalign">
        Accurate crop yield prediction is essential for optimizing agricultural practices and ensuring food security. By
        using advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and data analytics, farmers can predict the expected
        yield of their crops based on factors such as weather conditions, soil health, irrigation levels, and crop
        variety. This helps in planning better resource management, reducing waste, and enhancing productivity.
        Additionally, predictive models can assist in mitigating risks from climate change, pests, and diseases,
        ensuring more sustainable and efficient farming practices.
